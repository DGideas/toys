# DGideas' toys

这个仓库存放了我在大学以前写过的各种有趣的程序，其中大部分是用Visual Basic 6.0编写的，少数采用了C++、PHP或者其他语言。
最近正在整理以前存放的文件，突然翻出来很多小时候写的程序，删除实在可惜，放在GitHub上来纪念我小时候的生活。

This repo manages source code I made before I became a freshman. Most of them were written by Visual Basic 6.0, and others written in C Plus Plus or PHP. 
I try to archieve my files these days, and I found lots of works I made when I am a little boy, so I put them on GitHub to memory my childhood life.
